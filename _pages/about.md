Hi! I am Ummea Salma. Recently completed my master's in Computer Science and Engineering from University of Connecticut. I was fortunate to have Professor [Bing Wang](https://bing.cse.uconn.edu/) as my advisor and Professor [ Minmei Wang](https://minmei-wang.github.io/) as my co-advisor. My research interests are in Computer Network, Network Security, Social Media Mining and Deep Learning. I did an independent research on secure data sharing system for Vehicular Network. I hold another M.S degree in Information Technology from Institute of Information Technology, University of Dhaka. I completed my B.Sc in Computer Science and Engineering from Stamford University Bangladesh.

In my free time I enjoy taking care of my houseplants. I love drawing, specially Mandalas. I am also interested in photography and cooking as well.
